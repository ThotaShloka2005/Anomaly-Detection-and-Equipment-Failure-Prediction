Project Overview
This project focuses on building an anomaly detection system for paper manufacturing machinery. The goal is to identify unusual patterns in sensor data that may indicate equipment failures, enabling predictive maintenance and early warning systems.

Learning Objectives
Understand and implement anomaly detection algorithms

Apply machine learning techniques for predictive maintenance

Work effectively with sensor and equipment data

Design early warning systems to reduce downtime and maintenance costs

Dataset
Time-series sensor readings from paper machinery

Maintenance and failure records

Data format: CSV files containing sensor values over time

Tools and Libraries
pandas for data manipulation

scikit-learn for machine learning models (e.g., Isolation Forest)

matplotlib and seaborn for visualization

Optional: advanced anomaly detection libraries (e.g., PyOD)

Usage
Load and preprocess sensor data

Train anomaly detection models to identify unusual patterns

Visualize detected anomalies and sensor trends

Predict potential equipment failures and schedule maintenance

Installation
Install required Python packages using:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Expected Output
Jupyter notebook with anomaly detection models and results

Visualizations highlighting anomalies in sensor data

Predictive maintenance scheduling recommendations

Implementation plan for deploying in a production environment
